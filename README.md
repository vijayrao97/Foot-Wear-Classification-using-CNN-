# Foot-Wear-Classification-using-CNN-

Problem Statement : 

E-commerce has rapidly grown and their business strategies are completely based on user actions and user experiences. Although it is completely based on users, we should also not forget to say that there is a technology bridge in between users and growth in business. It may be Machine Learning or Deep Learning. Companies apply many image classification techniques on data to improve their catalog and give best suggestions to the users. They need accurate product classification on their platforms for better user experience. But when you talk about products, there exists a huge variety and classifying within varieties is really challenging. As a Deep Learning engineer, you should always try cracking these kinds of challenges by classifying things within a product itself.

In this project we have used Alexnet architecture for building the CNN model.
